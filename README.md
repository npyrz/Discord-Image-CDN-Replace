# Discord-Image-CDN-Replace IN DEVELOPMENT
- CDN Image Replaced with 3rd party image hosting automatically when user sets image in discord because discord image links only last 7 days

## TIMELINE
- 12/17/2024 DAY 1
    - Setup bot, and added feature for the bot to listen for any attachments and get the discord cdn which will be replaced. After getting the discord cdn it downloads the image to "imgs" directory. Did a little research with IMGUR API and my path for implementation using the API. Planning onto doing a little more research tomorrow and hopefully get some sort of implemenation started. Plan on setting up API account and using Postman to manage requests. Need to fix/add support for video files currently works only for images.
